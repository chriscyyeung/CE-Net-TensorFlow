# Retinal Vessel Segmentation

Implementation of the CE-Net architecture proposed by Gu et al. at [IEEE 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02740) and the RV-GAN architecture proposed by Kamran et al. at [MICCAI 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00535) using the TensorFlow framework. This repository is based on the source code released with the respective papers, and can be found here: [CE-Net](https://github.com/Guzaiwang/CE-Net) and [RV-GAN](https://github.com/SharifAmit/RVGAN).
